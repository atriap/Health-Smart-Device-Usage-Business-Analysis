# Health Smart Device Usage Business Analysis

This is Google Professional Certificate Final Capstone Project (Unguided), on Wellness Tech Company, Bellabeat. Taking the role as Marketing Data Analyst to answer some business questions to increase the sales and optimize the marketing strategy.

**Tools**: R - R Studio (Markdown)

**Scenario**:
Bellabeat's founder and Chief Creative Officer aware that analysis of health smart device users data would reveal more opportunities for growth, hence asking Marketing Data Analyst to help analyze trends from users usage. Dataset source: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

**Business task** : Analyze FitBit usage data to gain insight into how users use their smart devices and make recommendations for developing Bellabeat marketing strategies.

Questions that arise to help the analysis process:
1. What are the trends in the use of smart devices?
2. How can this trend be applied to Bellabeat subscribers?
3. How can this trend help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?


## Prepare

### Dataset information

There are 18 files in CSV format that available. What user informations are available?
- Activity (daily)
- Activity intensity (daily, hourly, per minute)
- Total calories burned (daily, hourly, minute)
- Number of heart rate (seconds)
- Steps (daily, minutes, hourly)
- Weight
- Sleeps (daily, minutes)
- MET (minutes)

**Decide** and **focus** on which datasets are relevant and can answer the questions. In this case, I choose the following datasets:
- Activity (daily)
- Sleep (daily, minutes)
- Calories (minute)
- Steps (hourly)
- Heart rate

The reason for choosing these datasets is because the data in the `intensity` dataset is sufficiently summarized in the `daily activity` dataset. Meanwhile, the `calories` and `steps` dataset only in minutes because its daily amount is already summarized the `daily activity`. Meanwhile, the reason for choosing the `heart rate` dataset is to see trends in their daily activities.

### Is the Data ROCCC?
ROCCC in data stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited

1. **Reliable** — Not quite reliable, this dataset only contains data from thirty users, so the sample size is too small and may not reflect the actual behavior of the entire population of users 
2. **Original** — Not original, obtained from third party which is Amazon Mechanical Turk survey
3. **Comprehensive** — Overall quite complete, but some datasets have lesser inputs, for example, only 24 users in sleep related datasets
4. **Current** — Not current, This dataset generated by respondents between **03.12.2016-05.12.2016** which is already 5 years ago so it might be not relevant anymore
7. **Cited** — Data obtained from third party in Kaggle

The Data is **not ROCC** hence it is a bad data. But i still will continue do the analysis based on this data. 

### Define the initial hypothesis based on prior knowledge
- Hours of sleep affect a person's activity, and vice versa. For example, people whose sleeping hours are less than ideal will affect their activities become lighter / sedentary, and vice versa
- The more / intense activity per day / hour, the higher the calories burned
- The more steps, the higher the calories burned
- The heavier the activity, the higher the heart rate


Then, start preparing the data for analysis, starting from importing libraries needed in R Studio.
### Importing Library
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
```

As stated before,this analysis will use data from 6 datasets. Then, continue to examine the data briefly.
### Importing the dataset
```{r}
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
head(daily_activity)

daily_sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
head(daily_sleep)

hourly_sleep <- read.csv("minuteSleep_merged.csv")
head(hourly_sleep)

hourly_calories <- read.csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
head(hourly_calories)

hourly_steps <- read.csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
head(hourly_steps)

heart_rate <- read.csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
head(heart_rate)
```

## Data Cleaning
Most datasets are not "clean" enough. There might be duplicates, incorrect formats, missing values, and inconsistent field names. Therefore, the following steps will be done to make the data ready to be analyzed.
### Checking unique ID each dataset
```{r}
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(daily_sleep$Id)
n_distinct(hourly_sleep$Id)
n_distinct(hourly_steps$Id)
n_distinct(hourly_calories$Id)
n_distinct(heart_rate$Id)
```
`daily_activity`, `hourly_steps`, and `hourly_calories` consists of 33 distinct user IDs, while `daily_sleep` and `hourly_sleep` only consists of 24 user IDs. `heart_rate` dataset is removed because it only contains 14 unique user IDs and not representative enough (less than 50% participant).

### Check duplicates
```{r}
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
sum(duplicated(hourly_sleep))
sum(duplicated(hourly_calories))
sum(duplicated(hourly_steps))
```
There are duplicates in `daily_sleep` and `hourly_sleep` datasets, so the following steps will be done to make the analysis easier and neat.

### Make field names uniform and no duplicates
```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  clean_names() %>%              # to make field names more readable and uniform
  unique()

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  unique()                        # to make sure the data are unique / not duplicated
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))      # re-check the amount of NA

hourly_sleep <- hourly_sleep %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  unique()
sum(duplicated(hourly_sleep))     # re-check the amount of NA after data cleaning

hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  unique()

hourly_calories <- hourly_calories %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  unique()
```

### Check NA
```{r}
sum(is.na(daily_activity))
sum(is.na(daily_sleep))
sum(is.na(hourly_sleep))
sum(is.na(hourly_steps))
sum(is.na(hourly_calories))
```
All datasets have 0 NA value, so no further data cleaning needed.

Another step done in data cleaning is to check datatypes in each datasets to make calculation and analysis easier, like calculating numbers or make categories.
### Check Data Structures
```{r}
glimpse(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
glimpse(daily_sleep)
glimpse(hourly_sleep)
```
```{r}
glimpse(hourly_steps)
```
```{r}
glimpse(hourly_calories)
```
Previous step shows that data type for `date` columnns in every datasets are incorrect, it is *character* type and should be in *date* type

### Correcting date format

```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  rename(date = activity_date) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))

glimpse(daily_activity)
```

```{r}
daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  rename(date = sleep_day) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
glimpse(daily_sleep)
```

### Correcting data time format with as.POSIXct
```{r}
hourly_sleep <- hourly_sleep %>%
  rename(date_time = date) %>%
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz = Sys.timezone()))
glimpse(hourly_sleep)
```
```{r}
hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  rename(date_time = activity_hour) %>%
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz = Sys.timezone()))

glimpse(hourly_steps)
```
```{r}
hourly_calories <- hourly_calories %>%
  rename(date_time = activity_hour) %>%
  mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz = Sys.timezone()))

glimpse(hourly_calories)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis
After the datasets are ready, the trend will be seen in each related fields for further understanding and deeper analysis.
### Descriptive Statistics
```{r}
daily_activity %>% summary()
daily_sleep %>% summary()
hourly_sleep %>% summary()
hourly_steps %>% summary()
hourly_calories %>% summary()
```

After knowing the descriptive statistics for each datasets, start exploring trends in their habits.
### Plotting users habit: Application log 

```{r}
daily_activity %>%
  mutate(day = weekdays(date)) %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(app_log = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(day, app_log, fill = day)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(x=NULL,y="num of logs", title="Application log")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199954592-2dc74d76-bff9-4231-8c37-1b1147bad815.png)

The graph above shows that FitBit users **did not use the application every day**. Most of them only use the application / wearing the gadget in **Tuesday - Thursday**.


### Plotting User activities category distribution using a pie chart
How about their activity intensity each day?
```{r}
library(ggrepel)              # importing another library to make visualization labels

daily_activity %>%
  summarise(sedentary_mins = sum(sedentary_minutes), lightly_active_mins = sum(lightly_active_minutes), fairly_active_mins = sum(fairly_active_minutes), very_active_mins = sum(very_active_minutes)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols =1:4, names_to="category",values_to='total_mins') %>%
  mutate(percentage = total_mins/sum(total_mins)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(percentage)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = total_mins, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title="Activity", x=NULL, y=NULL) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = percentage),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), show.legend=F) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199954661-875ec325-ba4a-4037-8ed8-b736cbed6334.png)

The graph shows that users do sedentary activities the most on daily basis followed by light activities.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

### Merging datasets
For a deeper understanding of user habits, multiple data sets will be combined because they have multiple fields in common (primary key). It can also be used to observe correlation between two variables.

## 1. Daily activity and daily sleep record including 24 unique user ids.
As in the previous exploration results, the number of users who entered sleep activity data was 24 users. After that, the next step is data cleaning and a brief check of the datasets after they are combined.
```{r}
daily_activity_sleep <- left_join(daily_activity, daily_sleep, by=c("id", "date")) %>% drop_na()

glimpse(daily_activity_sleep)
head(daily_activity_sleep)
sum(is.na(daily_activity_sleep))
n_distinct(daily_activity_sleep$id)

# Modifying dataset by dividing dates into days of the week

daily_activity_sleep <- daily_activity_sleep %>%
  mutate(day = weekdays(date)) %>%
  select(id, day, date, everything())
head(daily_activity_sleep)
sum(is.na(daily_activity_sleep))
```

### Calculating users habit
#### Sleeping log

```{r}
daily_activity_sleep %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(app_log = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(day, app_log, fill = day)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(x=NULL,title="Application log (sleeping habit)")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199954801-67014963-aeb0-49a1-8339-621a1346959b.png)

The graph shows the same trend from `daily_activity` dataset, that users did not input their sleeping data every day but most often between Tuesdays and Thursdays.


#### Grouping users into activity intensity categories
The `daily_activity` dataset reveals that there are four types of activity: sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active. Now, Belabeat users will be grouped into those four types.
```{r}
user_intensities <- daily_activity_sleep %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  rename(sedentary = sedentary_minutes, light = lightly_active_minutes, fair = fairly_active_minutes, very = very_active_minutes) %>%
  mutate(
    intensities = case_when (
      light < mean(light) & fair < mean(fair) & very < mean(very) ~ "Sedentary",
      light >= mean(light) & fair < mean(fair) & very < mean(very) ~ "Light",
      fair >= mean(fair) & very < mean(very) ~ "Fair",
      very >= mean(very) ~ "Very Active"))

head(user_intensities)
sum(is.na(user_intensities$intensities))

user_intensities %>%
  select(sedentary, light, fair, very) %>%
  summary()

user_intensities %>%   
  ggplot(aes(intensities, fill = intensities)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title="User intensities", x=NULL, y="users")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199954929-ce848977-9b7a-4031-b675-0fd83849964b.png)

From the graph, it is known that based on the dataset, the majority of FitBit users who enter their activity data completely (including their sleep activity) are the ones who are **active**.

How about their intensities based on day of the week? which day are they most active and most relaxed?
#### User intensities per Day of the week

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
user_intensities %>%   
  ggplot(aes(day, fill = day)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title="Intensities per Day", x=NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~ intensities)
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199955184-c0b1e809-1263-42e4-902b-095963b43f27.png)

The answer is, most of users do sedentary activities in **Sunday** and heavy activities in **Tuesday.**


#### Plotting the correlation between activity intensities and calories burned
After knowing users habits related to their activity each day, how about the amount of calories burned?
```{r}
ggplot(user_intensities, aes(x=sedentary, y= calories)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Sedentary Activity vs. Calories burned", x="sedentary activity minutes")

ggplot(user_intensities, aes(x=light, y= calories)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Light Activity vs. Calories burned", x="light activity minutes")

ggplot(user_intensities, aes(x=fair, y= calories)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Fairly Active Activity vs. Calories burned", x="fairly active activity minutes")

ggplot(user_intensities, aes(x=very, y= calories)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Heavy Activity vs. Calories burned", x="heavy activity minutes")
  
user_intensities %>%
  mutate(total_activity = sedentary+light+fair+very) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=total_activity, y= calories)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Total Activity vs. Calories burned", x="total activity minutes")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199955608-08524a96-bb75-4270-b640-9b7e49c7fe84.png)
![activity vs calories burned](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199956876-81510407-dbe8-4862-b48c-011152fb8f1c.jpg)

Heavy activity becomes the only type of activities that have positive correlation with amount of calories burned. The heavier the activity, the more calories burned.

#### Dividing users sleeping habit into categories
Sleep is needed after doing activities every day. In this step, the trend of the user's sleep habits will be monitored based on the category of sleep hours divided by [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html).
```{r}
user_sleep_steps <- daily_activity_sleep %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(mean_sleep = mean(total_minutes_asleep), mean_steps = mean(total_steps)) %>%
  mutate(
    sleep_quality = factor(case_when (
    mean(total_minutes_asleep) < 420 ~ "Not Enough Sleep", 
    mean(total_minutes_asleep) >= 420 & mean(total_minutes_asleep) <= 540 ~"Ideal", 
    mean(total_minutes_asleep) >540 ~ 'Too Much Sleep'),
    levels = c("Not Enough Sleep","Ideal","Too Much Sleep"))) %>%
  select(id, mean_sleep, sleep_quality, mean_steps) %>%
  unique()

head(user_sleep_steps)
glimpse(user_sleep_steps)
```
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199957068-96940438-070c-427d-9d9c-1dc626d6e1c1.png">

#### Calculating number of users with their sleeping habit
After dividing into three sleeping habit categories, we will see how many users have enough sleep and those who are not
```{r}
ggplot(user_sleep_steps, aes(sleep_quality, fill = sleep_quality)) +
  geom_bar() +
labs(x=NULL, fill="Users sleep quality")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199957123-e7e0998c-9a5c-4f3e-8e6f-d8d5919dac23.png)
The answer is, most of users have not enough sleep, means they sleep **less than 7 hours** each day.

#### Comparing the mean of steps taken each user with their sleep quality
Now we will see which category that took steps each day more
```{r}
ggplot(user_sleep_steps, aes(sleep_quality, mean_steps, fill = sleep_quality)) +
geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
labs(x=NULL, fill="Steps and sleep quality")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199957152-853f33e8-fea3-4fa4-a32e-5f0845690abb.png)
Users who did not have enough sleep took more steps in daily basis.

#### Plotting correlation between total steps taken and total sleeping minutes
Does the number of steps taken each day affect the user's sleep time?
```{r}
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x=total_steps, y= total_minutes_asleep)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Total steps vs. Sleep Duration", x="Total steps", y="Sleep duration") 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199957205-0a7503b2-e51c-4b8a-948c-126f4d31c8ff.png)

The graph shows **no correlation** between total number of steps taken and sleep duration.


#### Plotting correlation between total activites duration throughout the day and total sleeping minutes
The number of steps per day doesn't affect the sleep duration, but how about with the total activity duration in a day?
```{r}
user_intensities %>%
  mutate(total_activity = sedentary+light+fair+very) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=total_activity, y= total_minutes_asleep)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Total active time vs. Sleep duration")

ggplot(user_intensities, aes(y= total_minutes_asleep, x=very)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Heavy activity time vs. Sleep duration", y="Total minutes asleep", x="Heavy activity (minutes)")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199957264-6ce872b7-64e4-43b6-9a8b-0a6d4f385e43.png)

The graph above shows that there is a negative correlation between total activity time and sleep duration. The longer activity time in a day, the less the sleep duration.

```{r}
user_intensities %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = (sedentary+light+fair+very), total_awake = total_time_in_bed - total_minutes_asleep) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=total_awake, y=total_activity)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/200128116-fd6e1ab8-7b80-49f4-b0e3-8ac5fed34477.png)

The graph shows that there is a negative correlation between the total minutes awake and the time of activity carried out every day, meaning that the more active users, the longer the time they are awake even though they are already on the bed.

```{r}
user_intensities %>% 
  mutate(total_awake = total_time_in_bed - total_minutes_asleep) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=day, y=total_awake, fill=day)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/200128104-b05cf705-f291-49db-927c-abab0fbe4b01.png)

From this graph, it is known that most of users are having *difficulty* to actually sleep in **Sunday**, the day before work day, Monday. 


## 2. Hourly steps and hourly calories including 33 unique user ids.

### Merging datasets
Another datasets are merged to analyze number of steps and calories burned hourly trends. 
```{r}
hourly_steps_cal <- left_join(hourly_steps, hourly_calories, by=c("id", "date_time"))

glimpse(hourly_steps_cal)
head(hourly_steps_cal)
sum(is.na(hourly_steps_cal))
n_distinct(hourly_steps_cal$id)
```

### Dividing time of the Day
Analysis will be easier if hours divided into four time categories in a day, by *morning*, *afternoon*,  *evening*, and *night*.
```{r}
breaks <- hour(hm("00:00", "6:00", "12:00", "18:00", "23:59"))

labels <- c("Night", "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening")

hourly_steps_cal %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = cut(x=hour(date_time), breaks = breaks, labels = labels, include.lowest=TRUE))
```
<img width="539" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104981673/199957395-b54b8bd3-becb-4a0c-954a-089c9b6a8966.png">

### Plotting amount of calories burned based on time of the day

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
hourly_steps_cal %>% 
  separate(date_time, sep = " ", into = c("date","time")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as_date(date), time = format(parse_date_time(as.character(time), "HMS"), format = "%H:%M")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, calories, fill=time)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +

The graph shows positive correlations between total steps taken each day and amount of calories burned


# Summary
- Users tend to remember logging in to the application / using the device in the midweek (Tuesday-Thursday) more than weekends
- Active users are more enthusiastic about entering their data completely than less active users 
- The trend shows that calories are burned the most in the afternoon and least burned at the evening. It indicates that users activity is more heavy in the afternoon.
- The more steps each day, the more calories burned. However, the number of steps per day does not affect the user's sleeping habits
- Most of users are having *difficulty* to actually sleep in **Sunday**, the day before work day, Monday.


# Recommendation
## How can this trend be applied to Bellabeat subscribers?

## How can this trend help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?
